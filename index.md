### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it taught me how to use cout and cin.
    It is something that we are using all the time, so it was very helpful to
    learn. I enjoyed the fact that it was so short and easy, now I just cry
    while coding.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because I always wanted to learn how to code
    images and get them on display. Doing this lab was a bit of work since I tend
    over complicate things and rewrote the code twice. Once I was able to do it,
    it was 6am and i started at 2 pm, but it was worth it.


* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a favorite because I was able to learn about classes. Though
    it was hard at first, it paid off in the end. Now I am able to code classes but
    I can't code myself to get an A in them.
